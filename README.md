# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project is a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a given sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. The model is built using Python and employs various machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar readings used to distinguish between rocks and mines. Each instance in the dataset contains 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal strength at different frequencies.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and identifying key patterns.
- Model Training: Implementing supervised learning models to classify sonar signals.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
